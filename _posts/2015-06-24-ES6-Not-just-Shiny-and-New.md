Now that ES6 is basically finalized, should we care yet? We'll talk about some of the great new features that can benefit your current projects.

[Aaron Nielsen](http://www.meetup.com/coloradospringsjs/members/29245352/) is a Colorado native from Littleton. He holds a BSEE from the Colorado School of Mines and has worked in oilfield services, airborne entertainment systems, aerospace, defense, law enforcement, and satellite communications. He has spent most of his career as a software engineer with wide enough exposure to qualify as a “full stack” developer and architect. In the fall of 2011, Aaron founded Blooco, a software consulting company providing SaaS and mobile solutions to startups and established businesses. Aaron currently lives in Colorado Springs with his wife and 4 children. They enjoy most outdoor activities, but especially snowboarding, backpacking, and fishing.
