This months was a discussion lead by [Barry (Baz) O'Mahony](http://www.meetup.com/coloradospringsjs/members/8806516) on some basic NodeJS tools to use in development and production. 

A soup to nuts look at building a simple web application and supporting API using

* Express 4 
* Swig
* Mongoose
* Mocha, Sinon and Chai

This will be a (mostly) live coding event, so heckling is encouraged. I will explain the reasoning for my architectural decisions. Please, please, please tell me when you don’t agree!

I’ll also be bringing pizza and there shall be beers after courtesy of [Shutterstock](http://shutterstock.com/).
