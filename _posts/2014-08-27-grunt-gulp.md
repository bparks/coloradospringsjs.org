This months was a discussion lead by [John Ferris](http://www.meetup.com/coloradospringsjs/members/6504248/) on Grunt & Gulp. 

We'll talk a little bit about what task runners are and how they are useful (spoiler alert: Automation of the tedious stuff!).  What the differences are between Grunt & Gulp and when to choose one over the other. We'll also look at a bunch of use cases.  If you're already using task runners, we'd love to hear about it!
